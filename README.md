# odin-recipes
Not my first website but the last time I built one was back in highschool which would be 2010.
This recipes website will contain various vegan pastry recipes that I would like to make
Once I have completed this, I would have a more idea on how to use git and eventually incorporate the use of CSS which is completely new to me
